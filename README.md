# towerjump
Problem statement
Jack is playing a 2D game. In that, there are N towers aligned in a straight horizontal line from left to right. Jack has to move from right to left by jumping. He can jump over K towers provided they all are shorter than or equal to the current tower. Find the value of K for each tower.
Input
First line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases.
Second line contains an integer N specifying the number of towers.
Third line contains n space separated integers(H[i]) denoting the height of each tower.
Output
Print the value K for each tower separated by a space.
Explanation: For 7th term there are 5 tower smaller than itself.
Similarly for 6th there are 3 towers.
Constraint
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= H[i] <= 10^8
